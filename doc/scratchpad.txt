ScratchPad, toggle a scratchpad              *ScratchPad* *scratchpad*

This plug-in adds a key binding, by default `dsp` (= `Display Scratch Pad`), that toggles
a scratchpad. By default, it assumes the filetype `FT` and working directory `CWD` of the
currently active buffer, and is stored in `CWD/.scratchpads/scratchpad.FT`

The directory where the scratchpad is stored in is set by the variable
>
    let g:scratchpad_path = '.scratchpads'
<
It may be an absolute or relative path. If it is a relative path (such as, by
default `.scratchpads`), then it is relative to the working directory of the
currently active window. 

The filetype of the scratchpad is set by the variable
>
    let g:scratchpad_ftype = ''
<
If it is empty (as by default), then the filetype is that of the currently
active buffer.

The key binding is set by the mapping
>
    nmap dsp <Plug>(ToggleScratchPad)
