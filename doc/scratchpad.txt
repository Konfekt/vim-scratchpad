ScratchPad, toggle a scratchpad              *ScratchPad* *scratchpad*

This plug-in adds a key binding, by default dsp (= `Display Scratch Pad`), that toggles
a scratchpad. It assumes the file type `FT` and working directory CWD of the
currently opened buffer, and is stored in CWD/.scratchpads/scratchpad.FT

The subdirectory where the scratchpad is stored in is set by the variable
>
    let g:scratchpad_path = '.scratchpads'
<
and the key binding is set by the mapping
>
    nmap dsp <Plug>(ToggleScratchPad)
